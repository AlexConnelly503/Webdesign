<p>My name is Alex, and I am from Nesconset, NY which is a suburb of Long Island. I am a senior studying finance here in New Paltz. I try to spend as much time as I can outdoors, and I am always on the go. I manage my time across my school workload, part-time job, and my hobbies/passions. I have a part-time job at a bicycle shop in New Paltz, which coincides well with my passion for cycling and mountain biking. Cycling is one of my favorite ways to get outside and be active, as it is a great form of exercise, and is super fun. I also like to go hiking and backpacking when given the opportunity and have also dabbled in some rock climbing. My interest in the finance field began when I took some business classes in high school. Since then, I have learned a lot about the world of business, financial markets, and how large companies manage their funds and resources. I hope to put this knowledge to use after graduating and plan to work full-time by this coming fall. I aspire to one day work within an industry I am passionate about and even start my own business someday down the road.   </p>
